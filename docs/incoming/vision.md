Ticker is an Open Source Chrome Extension that can (currently) manage your ToDo List. In near future it will be also able to manage your Google Calender, Google Task and Google Keeps transforming it into a single stop life management solution. All of these features will be incorporated without loosing focus on the user experience and simplicity of the application. 

When working on something important you often need to quickly add something to your To-Do List but switching the website or picking up the phone is all that it take to break the flow. That is why this project exist, to provide a quick and convenient access to your productivity tools without interrupting. The extension is designed to be easy to use so that you spend less time figuring the extension and more time doing actual work. 

There are 3 main objectives of this project and those are listed below:
- Extension should be Easy to Use.
- It should be unobtrusive for the user.
- The form shall not dominate over function, rather should be developed simultaneously.

Achieving this is difficult but we owe it to ourselves to try. This project aims to help large groups of people to have uninterrupted work session and produce there best work. 

Let come together and contribute our energies into a shared goal to transform this project into an essential tool for modern work life. If you are looking for some ideas for improving the project we have some idea (in `ideas.md`) that might hook you in. Make sure that you open an issue so that other know what you are working on so as not to result in the duplication of efforts.
