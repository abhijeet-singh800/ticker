## Installation
This document will discuses the step required to install this extension. Unfortunately this extension is not on Chrome Extension Store (yet) so we have to take some manual step  to successful install this application.

### Downloading the Extension 
First we need to download the build files for the latest release of the extension. [Click Here](https://github.com/abhijeet-singh800/ticker/releases) to go to the release page and download the `distribution_files_vX.X.X.zip` for the latest release. After downloading the extension unzip it at a convenient place.

### Enabling Developer Mode 
Go to `chrome://extensions/` on your browser, this will open the extension page where you will have all your installed extensions. Look to the top right corner of the screen and you will find the `Developer Mode` toggle, turn it on.
