Shadcn UI is a UI component library for React applications that provides pre-built, customizable components built using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives. Given are some key features of the component library

### Features
- Tailwind CSS: ShadCN UI components are styled using Tailwind CSS, which makes them highly customizable and responsive. Developers can easily modify components using Tailwind's utility classes.
- Modular & Extensible: Instead of being a monolithic library, ShadCN UI promotes modularity by allowing developers to install only the components they need. Each component can be independently installed, keeping the app lightweight.
- Theming: It integrates well with theming systems, making it easy to adapt the design to various themes, including light, dark, or custom color schemes.

This project uses the many components from this library mainly Dropdown Menu and Forms. Files related to Shadcn-UI are present in `/src/shadcn/components/ui`
