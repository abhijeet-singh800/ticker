This repository uses End-to-End Testing strategy to test itself. Let's discuss this a little further before jumping in its implementation for this repo.

# End-to-End (E2E) Testing
End-to-end (E2E) testing is a testing methodology used to validate the functionality and performance of an application by simulating real-world user interactions. The goal is to ensure that the entire workflow of the application from the user interface (UI) to backend systems works as expected. In E2E testing, tests are conducted from the user's perspective, interacting with the application through the UI to simulate tasks like form submissions, navigation, and data processing.

E2E tests help catch issues that unit or integration tests might miss, such as bugs caused by miscommunication between different system parts. For example, in an e-commerce site, E2E tests would cover a complete purchase process: logging in, browsing products, adding items to the cart, completing checkout, and receiving confirmation.

# Implementation 
This repo uses the Cypress Testing Library.It's JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework designed for modern web applications. Cypress is known for its fast, reliable tests, real-time reloading, and powerful debugging features. It runs directly in the browser, giving full access to the DOM and network requests.
