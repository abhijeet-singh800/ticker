This repo has a GitHub Project linked to it , the Projects section on top of the page. The project section serves as an Idea filtering board for the future release and as a Timeline for the current issues that are been worked on. Thus there are two views in the Tickers project, these are Ideas Pipeline and the Issues Roadmap. Ideas Pipeline is a place of storing and filtering unbaked ideas and the Issues Roadmap is a way of tracking the real issus and improvement for the repo. When viewed in conjunction with GitHub Milestones these convey the vector in which the project is ascending. 

# Milestones 
These are the next big thing that the repository is trying to achieve. These may or may not have well defined issues for its completion. They represent some arbitrary goal set be the community that is meant to be the primary focus of the community until that milestone is achieved.

# Ideas Pipeline
The Idea Pipeline is an funnel for collecting all the Ideas in one place and filtering the best one that are later worked one. This is a Kan Ban style board that has 5 columns each representing a stage of an Issue in form of an Idea. Form left we have The Bakery, Current Milestone, Up Next, In Progress and Done sections of this board. Small explanation for all these sections are given below. 

- Bakery - This column contains all the unbaked ideas in form of draft issues in the one place. If in future they turn out to be a good ideas to be worked for the next Milestone they are transferred to the next column that is Current Milestone.
- Current Milestone - This columns contains all the draft issues that are meant to be fixed to achieve the current milestone. This ensure that our milestone have well defined objectives that are not missed out in the day to day development.
- Up Next - These are accepted Ideas ready to be worked on for the future release. At this stage the draft issue is converted into a real issue. This section can only have 3 issues at one time preventing the future overload on the repo. This is also the stage when these issue make an entry on the Issues Roadmap view of the project.
- In Progress - These are the issues that are actively been work on by contributors. This can have 2 issues at a time for the same reason stated above. 
- Done - These are the issues that are fixed by the team.

# Issues Roadmap
This view provides an timeline perspective to all the accepted ideas/issues for the repo, this is a place to plan and make a structured issues so that all the people in the community are aware of the timeline.
