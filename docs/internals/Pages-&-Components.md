### UI Elements üñ•Ô∏è
`src/components` contains independent components that are build in React and combined with other components to form pages that are stored in `src/pages` . Other then that most of the things are self explanatory in code. These two folder contains all the UI code for the extension and uses the `src/utils` modules. 

To understand it a little better if Pages are the walls that are going to be displayed to the user then components are the bricks that make up the wall. Some times these components are used more then one time for example `TaskForm.tsx` is used in `New.tsx` and also in `Task.tsx`.
